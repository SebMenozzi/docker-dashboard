# DOCKER DASHBOARD

This is a simple docker dashboard I made for my projects to make it easier for
me to get logs and stats of my containers.
Feel free to propose new features that would be useful to add!

## Installation

-   Install Node.js => https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (if not already done)
-   Run **npm i**

## Launch the dashboard

-   Run **npm run build**
-   Run **npm start**

## To Keep a clean codebase

-   Run **npm run pretty** before committing!

You're all set, have fun!
